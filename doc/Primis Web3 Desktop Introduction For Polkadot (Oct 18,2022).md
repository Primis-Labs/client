## Project Overview

### Overview
Primis Desktop provides a one-stop Web3 integrated client for the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Primis Web3 Desktop for Polkadot-Key Components

**Primis Wallet**  (Available NOW on [Primis.cc](primis.cc))

Primis Desktop Wallet is the best tool to manage multi-chain assets on the Polkadot ecosystem, such as Polkadot, Kusama, and other parachains (like Acala, Astar, Moonbeam). Asset management mainly includes digital/NFT assets' checking, sending, receiving, and trading records on the Polkadot ecosystem.

 **P2P Chat** (Working on it)

Primis Desktop provides encrypted chat groups for Polkadot ecosystem users to discuss decentralized Gov2 governance and Proposal freely. ZK-Proof technology will be combined into Primis chat groups to offer more privacy and decentralized DAO governance space. 

Primis Desktop could automatically create encrypted chat groups for Polkadot ecosystem DApps, each DApp has its own independent chat group.

**Subscribe** (Working on it)

Primis Desktop also is a place for users to subscribe to Polkadot decentralized notifications like EPNS. Initially, Primis Desktop will provide asset change notifications for Polkadot, Kusama, and other parachains. More on-chain DApps notifications to exploit in the future.

**Primis Web3 PNS Browser (Working on it)**

Primis Desktop will gestate a Chrome-compatible PNS browser for the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing Polkadot ecosystem users to access Web2 pages and interact with Web3 DApps freely. Primis Web3 PNS Browser supports Polkadot ecosystem PNS domains’ resolution and visit. 


Unlike traditional browsers such as Chrome, Brave, and Web2 centralized Cloud Service, Primis Web3 PNS Browser is based on a data relay network, where access and application data are transmitted to clients or Primis terminals through a relay network of Primis nodes.

**DApp Self-Hosting Platform (Working on it)**

Primis Desktop provides the plug-in function. All DApps on the Polkadot ecosystem can integrate and deploy on the Primis relay node network and upgrade and confirm through the reliable connection contract in a smart contract to ensure applications’ security.
